/* Since I cannot programmatically remove backgrounds from images in this environment,
   here are your options:

   1. Use an online tool like remove.bg to remove the black background from your logo
   2. Or provide me with a PNG version that already has transparency
   3. For now, I'll update the CSS to handle the black background nicely

   Your original logo is saved as: public/logo-original.jpg
